Pumpkin Soup

Butternut Pumpkin | 1 Whole (aprox 800g)
Potatoes          | 2 Medium Sized (aprox 330g)
Onion             | 1
Red Lentils (dry) | 1 cup (160g) 
Water             | 1 cup (250ml)
Butter            | 200g
Vanilla           | 2tsb+
Eggs              | 4

I like to put it in a pressure cooker for 30 minutes, then blend it to perfection.
